## 🎥 Demo Video (60 seconds)

### Script
**[0:00-0:03] HOOK**
> "HTTP 402 has been dormant for 28 years. We just woke it up — and made it visible."

**[0:03-0:15] PROBLEM**
> "Payments are invisible. You don't know who's paying, how much, or for what. Traditional analytics don't work for micropayments."

**[0:15-0:40] SOLUTION**
- Connect wallet → Dashboard loads
- "Provider view: see your endpoint revenue"
- Switch to Consumer view
- Show Provider Leaderboard
- Show Transaction Map
- Show Fraud Dashboard

**[0:40-0:45] PROOF**
> "26 real Stacks testnet transactions. No mocks. Real blockchain."

**[0:45-0:55] DIFFERENTIATOR**
> "While others build payment apps, we built the infrastructure layer the entire ecosystem needs."

**[0:55-1:00] CTA**
> "x402Metrics. Bloomberg Terminal for HTTP payments. Built on Stacks."

### Recording Checklist
- [ ] Record in 1080p or higher
- [ ] Clear audio (use good mic)
- [ ] Show URL at end
- [ ] Keep under 60 seconds
- [ ] Upload to YouTube (unlisted is fine)
- [ ] Note video URL: __________________

**Description:**
```
x402Metrics is the first production-ready analytics dashboard for the HTTP 402 (Payment Required) protocol on Stacks blockchain. While other projects build payment applications, we built the intelligence layer that makes the entire x402 ecosystem visible, measurable, and trustworthy.

Key Features:
✅ Real-time payment analytics with Socket.io

✅ Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
✅ Wallet integration (Xverse/Leather)

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js, Socket.io, TypeScript
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Blockchain: Stacks L2 (testnet)
- Real-time: WebSocket updates

Why x402Metrics Wins:
1. Infrastructure > Applications - We enable other projects, not compete with them
2. Real Blockchain Proof - 26 testnet transactions, not mocks
3. Visual Impact - Glassmorphism UI that looks 2026
4. Technical Depth - Fraud detection, multi-role, real-time
