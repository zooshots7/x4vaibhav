- Built 20+ MCP tools for AI agents
- Comprehensive agent infrastructure
- **BUT:** No analytics, no dashboard, no real transaction examples

### 2. **SWARM** (39230) - Most Complex
- Telegram-based agent economy
- Agents can borrow/lend/invest
- 2 Clarity contracts deployed
- **BUT:** No web dashboard, no analytics
- **Our edge:** Clean UI, multi-role views, fraud detection

### 3. **x402Pay** (39297) - Infrastructure SDK
- Production SDK with 130+ tests
- 6 Clarity contracts
- Real-time analytics (mentioned)
- **BUT:** SDK for developers, not end-users
- **Our edge:** We have live dashboard with real data

## ✅ WHAT WE DO BEST

1. **Analytics & Observability** - ONLY project focused on this
2. **Multi-Role Dashboard** - Provider vs Consumer (UNIQUE)
3. **Real Blockchain Data** - 26 verified transactions (MOST SHOWN)
4. **Fraud Detection** - Security alerts (ONLY PROJECT)

## 🤝 NOT COMPETING - ENABLING

**Key Insight:** We're infrastructure, they're applications.

**Every project needs analytics:**
- OphirAI agents → need spending dashboards
- SWARM agents → need earning dashboards  
- ShadowFeed providers → need revenue dashboards
- Stacktreon creators → need subscriber analytics

**We enable the ecosystem.** 🚀
